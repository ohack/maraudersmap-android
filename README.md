# Marauder's map

Marauder's map helps students see where other students are on Olin's campus.


This repository is for *android client* development. For PC-client development, see 
[https://github.com/ohack/maraudersmap-client/](Marauder's Map Client Repository).

## About the Android Client

The original Android Client for Marauder's Map was written by Greg Marra. 

Goals and potential changes will be added here as the project progresses. The only current goal is to migrate the android client to use the RESTful JSON API provided in mauradersmap-server.
